This blog posts seeks to answer a simple question: does decentralization matter?

To break this down, we need to start out by defining decentralization, and then defining where we are talking about it.

## Defining decentralization

Decentralization seems like an obvious property, but then I thought of a few counterexamples. Let's delve into these examples, to try to figure out how we can properly define decentralization.

### Example 1: All validators in the same geographic region

What if all the Ethereum validators were ran inside of AWS? Specifically, what if 100% of the validators operated within the same AWS region, like US-East-1 (Northern Virginia)? Let us assume in this example that each validator is indeed all unique, individual human beings operating each machine. How decentralized is this system?

So, we let's say the network has 100 validators. Each validator maps to a unique human being. And each human being are in independent geographical regions and don't know each other.

So what part of knowing each other is dangerous? Well the issue comes from how it is easier to capture.

## Questions

1. Does it matter if unique validators know each other? How can we measure "how well separate validators are associated"?
2. Should the key metric for decentralization of the network be "the degree of decentralization of the resources responsible for determining who generates the blocks"?
3. How big is the power vector of the relationship between Ethereum core devs and the LSTs?
4. How does EIP-1559 / issuance affect the decentralization of the network over time?
5. What do we do when we can't measure the wealth distribution among accounts when they are pseudonymous? Do we need a Worldcoin solution or do we have to close our eyes and try to do our best, and hope for the best?
