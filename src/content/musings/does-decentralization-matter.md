This blog posts seeks to answer a simple question: does decentralization matter?

To break this down, we need to start out by defining decentralization, and then defining where we are talking about it.

## Defining decentralization

Decentralization seems like an obvious property, but then I thought of a few counterexamples. Let's delve into these examples, to try to figure out how we can properly define decentralization.

### Example #1: All validators in the same geographic region

What if all the Ethereum validators were ran inside of AWS? Specifically, what if 100% of the validators operated within the same AWS region, like US-East-1 (Northern Virginia)? Let us assume in this example that each validator is indeed all unique, individual human beings operating each machine. How decentralized is this system?

So, we let's say the network has 100 validators in consensus. Each validator is a unique human being.


## Questions

1. Does it matter if unique validators know each other?
